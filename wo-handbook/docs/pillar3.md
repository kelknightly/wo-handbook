# Pillar III - Client Services

## Introduction to the third pillar: Client Services

We dive into the strategies and best practices that enable us to deliver exceptional experiences and lasting value to our clients. From initial engagement to project execution, this pillar explores the key aspects of our client-centric approach.

## Project Methodology

Our team is from all over the world with different cultures, experiences, and perspectives. This positions us to make each project a success by matching our team with the right projects. We customise the project and participants around the client and the demands of the project to predictably deliver on time, and within budget.

At the core of our engagement is strategy discussion and collaboration. From workshopping the client requirements in detail to putting together top-line and more in-depth technical and non-technical scope documents, we always work to uncover why the client is pursuing a project by unpacking their goals and reasoning and we combine this with our own research. Throughout this process we continuously share and request feedback from our clients with the intention of keeping all stakeholders engaged throughout the engagement.

Internally we use Slack for high-bandwidth text communication. We use Notion, and Google Drive for document collaboration, and InVision for sharing high-fidelity web page designs, layouts, concept and moodboards, wireframes and prototypes, and image assets. Zoom is our go-to for high-bandwidth voice and video conferencing.

We also use Notion for managing our tasks and for day-to-day project management, design, and development that involves detailing tasks that are assigned to individual team members.

When we take on a project, our goal is to make sure that both our team and our client are all on the same side, pushing towards the same goals. We care deeply about the projects we work on and have a strong sense of pride for the work we do. We aim to be proactive rather than reactive, anticipating potential issues and discussing them openly with our clients at all times as the project progresses.

Projects are assigned an account manager and a project manager. The account manager is the clientâ€™s point of contact within Workshop Orange. Clients may also see communication from the project manager and other team members depending on how integrated the client is with our team. We encourage and maintain clear channels of communication that flow through specific team members, and we also allow organic and efficient relationships to develop.

Throughout our work, we value our client and team happiness. We track these metrics closely in weekly project portfolio overview meetings to make sure we are meeting expectations at every stage of the project.

Client meetings and reporting is customised to suit client preferences and needs. We are happy to make ourselves and our reporting data available as much or as little as is preferred.
