## Asynchronous Work

> Async work, collaboration, and communication means that employees work on their own time without the expectation of immediately responding to others.

As a **fully-remote, asynchronous operating** company, the people at Workshop Orange are not expected to work a certain number of hours a day or expected to be online at a certain time.

Each individual has the flexibility to decide when they would like to work each day, how long they would like to work each day, and how their day is segmented. This is naturally steered by who else in the company you interact with, internal meetings, and client expectations, which depend on your role.

### We operate primarily over two regions

üåé **AMER** (Americas)

üåç **EMEA** (Europe, Middle East, Africa)

Asynchronous communication makes it possible for us to operate over multiple regions. When staff in the AMER region are asleep, EMEA staff are typically awake and vice versa. 

Practically, asynchronous work means that staff in one region may do work and send messages to staff in another region without expecting an immediate reply. When the staff in the other region start working, they can respond.

### Basic principles of Async Work

1. We do not demand a 9am to 5pm working day
2. The hours we work depend on our role, client portfolio, meetings, and teammate interactions
3. The hours we work depend on our own personal requirements (e.g. gym, lunch, picking kids up from school)
4. The hours we work depend on our own personal energy levels (e.g. some people are more alert in the morning and tired in the afternoon)
5. Leave is not tracked
6. The time you‚Äôre at your desk it not tracked 
7. The amount of time you work is not tracked 
8. Hours are only tracked at a high level when there are budgetary implications. (e.g. when a developer or project manager needs to bill a client for their time, or when we need to do budget and time estimations for a project)
9. We prefer asynchronous communication where possible in order to accommodate staff in different timezones

> We value quality of work, meeting deadlines, clear and consistent communication, and client and team happiness over individual hours worked

## Managing your calendar

These are the calendar¬†management strategies we each rely on as collaborative team members:

- When scheduling a calendar event with multiple team members included, please make sure¬†another team member or 2 also have ownership / edit rights for the event.¬†That way there are a few people to jump in and edit / delete an event if needed (especially as the reason for changing an event is often because someone is off).
- When you're trying to arrange a meeting with another¬†team member (manager or colleague), first open their calendar and find a gap, drop an event into the gap and then share context in slack and ask if that time works. This saves a lot of to and fro in the conversation and it means only 1 person at a time is needing to calendar juggle instead of both.
    
> Being proactive rather than polite is more considerate
    
- Keep up to date with answering "Yes, No, Maybe"¬†on events shows recognition that you have actually seen the event in your calendar so that the other person knows you know.
- If you struggle with keeping up with your calendar, try a home desktop widget on your phone. Having your day‚Äôs events lined up on your phone home screen means at a quick glance you can see what's coming up next without having to alt tab or open an app, and that you can keep track of your day even while on the run or in a video call.

## Producing quality work

We care about work output, communication, quality, and level of involvement and innovation. We ask everyone to make themselves available to their teammates when they can, do good work and do it on time, communicate about your work efficiently and consistently, and be genuinely involved in documentation, chats, and meetings.

We also ask everyone to share their insights and ideas.

Make it clear that you are reading messages and documentation from your teammates and that you are actively involved on Notion and Slack.

You are responsible for structuring your own work life in a considerate but flexible way and communicating that structure.

Not every day needs to be an intense scramble to get things done. If you're not chasing a deadline or feeling the stress of following up with clients, that's totally ok.

## Leaving ‚Äúearly‚Äù or ‚Äúarriving‚Äù late

This is part of working asynchronously. Some of us like taking a long lunch around 1pm. Some people need to pick up their kids at 2pm. Maybe you find you come alive at night and do your best work in the evening. Maybe your family commitments means that a Friday or Monday off is liberating. 

Everyone works differently. If you are want to start work at midday on a Monday or want to leave early on a Friday, then do it. But make sure that you **communicate your plans and availability** and make sure there aren‚Äôt any fires to put out or people waiting too long on things from you. Make sure your work is done and that no one is depending on you for something in that time and everything will be fine. 

**It all comes down to managing expectations**

If you have joined Workshop Orange from an environment that is tightly monitored or controlled, we expect that you will likely feel a bit lost at sea the first time you decide to take leave, arrive late, or leave early. This is ok. Reach out to the first person you see online and let them know how you‚Äòre feeling. This won‚Äôt come naturally for everyone and we get that. This policy is not designed to cause stress and we‚Äôd like to help if it does.
