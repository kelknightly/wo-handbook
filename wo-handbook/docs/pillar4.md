# Pillar IV - Service Delivery

## Introduction to the fourth pillar: Service Delivery

Service delivery is another fundamental pillar, where we demonstrate our commitment to excellence and efficiency. We provide insights into our methodologies, tools, and quality assurance processes that ensure seamless project execution and superior outcomes.

## <span style="color: #dc4d01;"><strong>THINK</strong></span> | Strategic Process

Our Strategic Process asks: “Where are we now?”, “Where do we want to get to?”, “How will we get there? “How will we know when we get there?”. Key to this is measurement which allows us to set accurate targets and report on them frequently, and make ongoing optimisations continuously.

Our account and project management processes make sure that your budget, brand, and business are always well looked after.

## <span style="color: #dc4d01;"><strong>CREATE</strong></span> | Creative Process

We are purposeful in everything we design. While a beautiful, unique website or application might capture the attention of your audience, it needs to be paired with clear, crisp functionality to be useful. A truly outstanding user interface needs to be safe, unambiguous, fast, user-friendly, and accessible. It also has to be beautiful, enjoyable to use, and filled with carefully crafted copy.

We ensure that all the designed elements are cohesive and coherent across your various marketing channels and touchpoints.

Workshop Orange understands that your brand is what sets you apart from your competitors and helps prospects and partners quickly recognise your industry, while your visual identity shapes the perception of your brand. With Workshop Orange as your design partner, your digital identity will reflect your company's digital strategy and will be continually measured and adapted for efficacy.

## <span style="color: #dc4d01;"><strong>BUILD</strong></span> | Software Development Process

Our development process is design driven. We start with design, and development is driven by design and design thinking. Designers are deeply involved in the software development activities and remain the champions for the creative vision in everything we build. Along with the designers and developers, we involve you as the client in all continuous testing and feedback activities.

The Workshop Orange BUILD teams are driven by the thrill of building and deploying working software that meets the expectations of all stakeholders, from the business teams, through to your prospects and partners that engage with your digital touchpoints.

We are agile. We are effective. We are fast.

## <span style="color: #dc4d01;"><strong>RUN</strong></span> | Operations & Maintenance Process

Our operations service covers a wide range of functions, including keeping track of the progress of your digital strategy, deploying and maintaining your sites and apps, reporting on your digital performance, and making proposals on how to get more out of the digital component of your business.

With several decades of experience, our team drives your digital strategies, websites, and web apps, ensuring that your websites and web apps are secure, performant, and achieving the planned targets.

Additionally, we believe that a solid web analytics strategy and operational process is foundational to continuously elevating your site and ensuring you keep an engaged and relevant audience. Workshop Orange provides an array of web analytics services to suit your needs. We focus on providing consistent, clear reporting with actionable insights.

Everything we build and roll out in Workshop Orange is rolled out by our operations team, on state-of-the-art platforms such as [amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io/). We take proactive steps to make sure that the software and content underlying your digital footprint is secure, relevant, up to date, and performing well.

## <span style="color: #dc4d01;"><strong>SHOUT</strong></span> | Performance Marketing Process

We are all about driving the right traffic and getting it to convert against your planned goals. It is all about communication and is tightly integrated with the rest of our processes, as the lead and purchase generation process is as much about landing pages that convert well as it is about driving the right kind of traffic.

We offer Paid Media, Social Media Content and Community Management, Inbound “Funnel” Marketing, SEO, and Email automation & newsletters.

Our approach integrates all aspects of paid, owned, and earned media, all working together to drive clearly defined KPI targets. Our focus is on measurable outcomes that directly drive business objectives.
