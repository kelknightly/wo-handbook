# Pillar I - Mindset

## Introduction to the first pillar: The Workshop Orange Mindset

We emphasize a growth-focused and optimistic attitude, expecting our company and our team to continually evolve and embrace new opportunities in a composable and agile way. Our ten guiding principles serve as a compass, directing our actions and ensuring exceptional results for our clients.

## Composability: The future of business is composable. 

[Gartner Keynote: The Future of Business Is Composable]

> The concept of composable business is key in building resilience during times of disruption. Composable business enables organizations to swiftly assemble and reassemble components, keeping what works and discarding what doesn't. By 2023, it is projected that such businesses will outpace competitors by 80% in implementing new product features. Composable Businesses embrace autonomous teams, simplify customer interactions, and rapidly adjust resources in the face of Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity.

## Growth Mindset & Optimism

At Workshop Orange a mindset of growth and an optimistic attitude is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Embracing Innovation:** Composable approaches promote innovation and experimentation within businesses. By adopting a growth-focused mindset and fostering an optimistic attitude, consultants can encourage clients to embrace new ideas, explore creative solutions, and push the boundaries of their offerings. This mindset is essential for driving innovation and staying ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
2. **Adaptability and Agility:** Composable approaches enable businesses to quickly adapt and respond to changing market dynamics. A growth-focused mindset and an optimistic attitude encourage consultants and clients to be proactive, flexible, and open to change. This adaptability allows them to pivot strategies, reconfigure operations, and capitalize on emerging opportunities, ensuring long-term growth and success.
3. **Overcoming Challenges:** Growth-focused consultants with an optimistic outlook approach challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles. They view setbacks as learning experiences and remain resilient in the face of difficulties. This positive mindset helps clients navigate obstacles that may arise during the implementation of composable approaches, enabling them to persevere, learn from failures, and ultimately achieve growth.
4. **Building Client Confidence:** Growth-focused consultants with an optimistic attitude instill confidence in their clients. Their positive outlook and belief in the potential for success inspire trust and create a supportive environment. Clients are more likely to embrace composable approaches and take calculated risks when they have confidence in their consultants' ability to guide them toward growth and positive outcomes.
5. **Attracting Opportunities:** Growth-focused consultants who approach their work with optimism are more likely to attract new opportunities. Their enthusiasm, belief in possibilities, and track record of driving growth through composable approaches can attract clients, partnerships, and collaborations. This can further expand the consultancy's reach and reputation, leading to sustained growth and success.


> So a growth mindset and an optimistic attitude is important because it will drive innovation, adaptability, resilience, client confidence, and attract new opportunities. These qualities create an environment that is conducive to implementing and maximizing the benefits of composable approaches, ultimately leading to the growth and success of both the consultancy and its clients.

## Our ten guiding principles

The Workshop Orange approach is centered around ten guiding principles: focusing on what we can control, taking action and being proactive, acting virtuously to serve customers and each other, leading by example and shaping our culture, keeping our ego in check and avoiding distortions, recognizing that success is not guaranteed or entitled, exercising our will to control impulses and distractions, practicing resilience in the face of adversity, choosing our responses and judgments consciously, and cultivating gratitude for what we have and working towards our goals.

> ✓ **We focus on what we can control**  
The single most important Workshop Orange approach is differentiating between what we can change and what we cannot. What we have influence over and what we do not.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We take action**  
We pour all our energy into the things we can control. We refuse to be a passive victim of circumstances. We work hard to make our company better, serve our customers better, and in our small way to make the world better. We are proactive about this.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We act virtuously**  
Our primary mission is to be helpful to our customers and to each other. We don’t do this to make ourselves happy, we do it because it is a good way to do business, and a good way to be human.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We lead by example**  
We avoid moralizing and telling each others how to act. Instead we act as we should act, and we all lead our culture by example.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We keep our ego in check**  
We are proud of our accomplishments. But an unchecked ego will distort our view of our own abilities and significance. Ego can be the enemy of so many things. Of mastering our craft, creative insight, working well with others,  building loyal customers, and of repeating and retaining our success. Worst of all an unchecked ego will repulse advantages and opportunities.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We know that we are not entitled to success**  
We have goals that we want to achieve, and we work hard in pursuit of them, but we know that we’re not entitled to success.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We exercise our will**  
Impulses and distractions of all kinds are going to come, and our task is to control them. We think before we act.   
We ask: Who is in control here? What principles are guiding me?

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We practice resilience in adversity**  
The goal is to see adversity rightly and not let our business calm be destroyed by its arrival. We accept challenges without shock and strive to make every challenge the creation of greater things. We strive to find the value, opportunity, and truth in whatever happens.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We choose our responses**  
We understand that as humans, we don’t react to events; we react to our judgments about events.  
But we know that the judgments are up to us, and so we choose to judge and act accordingly.

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div> 

> ✓ **We are grateful**  
We don’t grieve for the things that we don’t have. Instead we celebrate the things we do have, and get to work building towards the things we want.

## Understanding the Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity (VUCA) of the modern world

VUCA is an acronym that stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. It originated in the military context but has since been widely adopted in business and organizational settings. VUCA represents the challenges and characteristics of an unpredictable and rapidly changing environment. Let's break down each element:

1. **Volatility:** Refers to the rapid and significant changes that can occur in an environment. It signifies the speed and magnitude of shifts that can disrupt normal operations and plans.
2. **Uncertainty:** Describes the lack of predictability and the inability to accurately foresee future events or outcomes. It implies a lack of clarity and makes decision-making more challenging.
3. **Complexity:** Reflects the intricate and interconnected nature of issues and systems. Complex situations involve multiple factors, relationships, and variables that can be difficult to understand and manage effectively.
4. **Ambiguity:** Refers to the lack of clear meaning or interpretation in a given situation. Ambiguous circumstances can lead to confusion, multiple interpretations, and a lack of consensus on the appropriate course of action.

Together, VUCA represents the heightened challenges that organizations face in a dynamic and rapidly changing world. Understanding and addressing VUCA factors is crucial for businesses to navigate uncertainty, make informed decisions, and adapt to the evolving landscape.

> Sounds bad, right??   
Nope.
